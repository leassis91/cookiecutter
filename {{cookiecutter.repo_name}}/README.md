# 1. Business Problem.

# 2. Business Assumptions.

# 3. Solution Strategy

My strategy to solve this challenge was:

## `Step 00. Settings and Data Extraction`
* Import of required libraries, packages and functions.
* Loading and checking available data via a CSV file.

## `Step 01. Data Description`
* Renaming of columns and checking the size of the dataset (assessing the need for tools to handle large volumes of data).
* Verification of data types in each column and type changes that are necessary for better treatment by the algorithms later
* Verification of missing data and decision on how to treat them (removal, artificial resampling, solution infeasibility)
* Brief statistical description of the numerical and categorical attributes in order to detect anomalies that are outside the scope of the problem, as well as the presence of possible outliers that will impact the performance of the algorithms later.

## `Step 02. Data Filtering`
* Filtering rows and deleting columns that do not contain information relevant to modeling or do not help to solve the problem.

## `Step 03. Feature Engineering`
Creation of variables (features) relevant to solving the problem

## `Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis
* Isolated analysis of each feature and its relationship with the others.
* Exploration of the data in order to obtain an intuition of their distribution in the data space (embedding exploration).

## `Step 05. Data Preparation`
* Data preparation to help machine learning models learn and perform more accurately.
* Selection of the embedding space best suited to the problem

## `Step 06. Feature Selection`
* Selection of the most relevant features to train the models

## `Step 07. Hyperparameter Fine Tuning`
* Testing different machine learning models and selecting the one with the best performance based on the chosen metrics (silhouette score)
* Choosing the best values for each parameter from the tested models that maximize performance

## `Step 08. Model Training`
* Training the models with the best parameters found and measuring their performance

## `Step 09. Cluster Analysis`
* Visual inspection of the data space assembled by each model
* Analysis of the profile (attributes) of each cluster for each model trained
* Choice of the final model that presents the best performance

## `Step 10. Exploratory Data Analysis for Business`
* Creation and testing of business hypotheses and elaboration of answers to business questions

## `Step 11. Deploy to Production`
* Planning and implementation of the model deployment architecture
* Creation of the database that will be used to solve the problem
